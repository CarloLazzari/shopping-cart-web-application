# Shopping-Cart-Web-Application
Shopping cart web type application built using the mvc pattern with Java, SQL, jsp, CSS, html. This web application project was needed to pass my *Web Engineering* course.

These were the **requirements** for the assignment:

1: The user must be able to view the products catalog, and can search for them either by Author, Title, or Number. The user can also view the product details and features.
2: Showcase of some products in a "push" area inside the home page.
3: The user can add new products to the catalog, and can modify/delete/block/unblock the existing ones, but only if he is a site administrator.
4: The user can add products to the shopping cart, purchase multiple quantities of each product and place an order in its speficic page, by adding the required delivery address and a payment mehod.
5: The user can change the status of each order and can view all the orders placed by each speficic user/all users, but only if he is a site administrator.
6: The user can block/unblock other users, making them unable to login.
