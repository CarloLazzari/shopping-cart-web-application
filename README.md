# Shopping-Cart-Web-Application
Shopping cart web type application built using the mvc pattern with Java, SQL, jsp, CSS, html. This web application project was needed to pass my *Web Engineering* course.

These were the **requirements** for the assignment:

**1.** The user must be able to view the products catalog, and can search for them either by Author, Title, or Number. The user can also view the product details and features.
**2.** Showcase of some products in a "push" area inside the home page.
**3.** The site administrator can add new products to the catalog, and can modify/delete/block/unblock the existing ones.
**4.** The user can add products to the shopping cart, purchase multiple quantities of each product and place an order in its speficic page, by adding the required delivery address and a payment mehod.
**5.** The site administrator can change the status of each order and can view all the orders placed by each speficic user/all users.
**6.** The site administrator can block/unblock other users, making them unable to login.
